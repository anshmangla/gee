    "Select only the dataset(s) from the 'options' list that are most relevant to answering the query. You may use more than one dataset if necessary.",
    "For each selected dataset, use only the parameters listed in its 'parameters' field. Do not use or mix parameters from other datasets.",
    "Respect each dataset's cadence (e.g., daily, 16-day, hourly) and spatial/temporal characteristics while designing your analysis.",
    "If the query implies a specific analysis (e.g., trend detection, anomaly detection, comparison), choose an appropriate method from a predefined list (e.g., analysis_options.txt)."
